## Features

- **Responsive Design:** This image gallery is built with responsiveness in mind. Whether your users are on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, they'll be able to enjoy your images in all their glory.

- **Click and Pop:** Clicking on an image thumbnail will pop up the selected image in the center of the screen, giving it the spotlight it deserves. This creates an immersive experience for users.

- **Easy Navigation:** Once an image is popped up, you can easily navigate through the gallery by clicking on the displayed image. Each click takes you to the next image in the sequence, creating a seamless browsing experience.

- **Lightweight Plugin:** I've incorporated a lightweight JavaScript plugin to enhance the functionality of the gallery without slowing down your website's loading speed.
